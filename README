groff macros for polish characters in postrscript and pdf
I've found these macros quite some time ago and I don't remember who made them and I'm not sure how exactly they work.
(probaly some ps specific positioning of accents, their aligning is not ideal)

testMacro.roff is an example how to use them. 
When using groff with -Kutf8 groff should auto replace missing characters with polish characters created by macros. 
test.sh should compile example file to out.pdf. 
You can check if macros are working by comparing out.pdf to screenshot in example.png
